# Advent of Code 2024
Solved in Rust and Go

## Description
This repository is a collection of solved days in Advent of Code using two programming
languages: **Rust** and **Go**. \
It serves the purpose of training these languages and making myself more proficient
in them. This means that, the solutions may not be the best and the solutions
will likely evolve with time as I become more accustomed to these languages. \
Feel free to check them out and send me tips if you have any. Let's grow together!

## Division of languages by days
- **Day 1** - Rust
- **Day 2** - Go
- **Day 3** - Rust
